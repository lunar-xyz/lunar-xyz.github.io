Welcome To My Personal Website - A Page To Showcase My Interests & Other Things

## About

I'm Lunar, a backend developer, client scripter, and exploit researcher based in the UK. I enjoy diving 
into challenging problems, whether it involves building reliable APIs, writing efficient client-side 
scripts, or uncovering subtle vulnerabilities. I get satisfaction from turning complex challenges into 
clean, working solutions and constantly learning new technologies. I also enjoy collaborating with others, 
sharing knowledge, and creating tools that make a real difference.
